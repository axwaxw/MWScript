#### What is MWScript?

__MWScript__ is the native scripting language of MoneyWorks.   It is baked into MoneyWorks and accessible to all users.

#### What is MWScript For?

Scripts are used to extend and enhance the functionality of MoneyWorks:  automating tasks, running calculations, generating reports, downloading or transmitting data to external sources, adding features to the user interface(UI) and so on.  

>**If you have ever thought that there was some functionality, feature or integration missing from MoneyWorks,**
>**there is a resonable chance that you can add or achieve it with MWScript.**

MWScript is immensely powerful, yet extremely approachable:  The language itself is comparatively simple and scripts can be composed, tested and deployed quickly and easily from within the MoneyWorks script editor.

#### Who is this Website For?

While some prior knowledge of scripting / coding will be an advantage, the examples included here are sufficiently simple to allow almost anyone to take advantage of the power and flexibility of MoneyWorks + MWScript.

#### Scope and Limitations

This site provides an introduction to MWScript and some useful examples of its application.  This is not a comprehensive reference to the language or functionality.  You will find a detailed reference within the Moneyworks Manual (online here or in MoneyWorks under __Help__) - and also from within the MWScript editor itself.

#### Sharing

As a long-time user of MoneyWorks - and one familiar with a number other accounting platforms - I am always discovering new capabilities and applications through MWScript.  

I am delighted to share some of the more generally applicable scripts here and I encourage you to explore its possibilities - and to share your discoveries.
