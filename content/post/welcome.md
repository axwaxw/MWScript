While some technical knowledge and experience is certainly and advantage, MWScript is a relatively simple language and its concepts and functionality will be familiar to anyone who has used the MoneyWorks report writer.  

This guide is designed to give an overview and introduction to MWScript and to demonstrate its power and flexibility.  The examples given are intended primarily to illustrate concepts and should be considered a starting point for your own customizations.  The guide is by no means comprehensive and your feedback and suggestions are very welcome.
